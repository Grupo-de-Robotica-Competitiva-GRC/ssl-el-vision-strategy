SSL-EL Vision/Strategy
=======================
This project is about the system of vision and strategy that GRC will use for the SSL-EL competition . It is based upon grSIM simulator(https://github.com/MaracatronicsRobotics/grSim.git) that comes with clients sample projects.


__How to use__

Create a build directory within the project (this is ignored by .gitignore):

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

```
Run CMake to generate the makefile (note: if you proceed with the installation, grSim will be installed into directory chosen, by default /usr/local):

```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..

```
Then compile the program:

```
$ make

```

The executable will be located on the bin directory.

Changes in the graphic interface: you should only run the "make" command again.
